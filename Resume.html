				<p>Hey! I'm Israel. I am a fledgling web developer and artist with hopes of doing it all for a living some day. I currently practice writing HTML and CSS, and I have aspirations of learning javascript in order to make my pages more dynamic. Although the layouts to my pages are basic, I make it important to implement the fundamentals of web development into each page I create.</p> 
				<p>But enought about me, feel free to explore the site and please contact me if you would like to get in touch!</p>
